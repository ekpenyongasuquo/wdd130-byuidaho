    <h2>Ekpenyong Mfon</h2>
    <p>The step I take to develop a growth mindset is to engage in challenging 
        tasks and also embrace mistakes. I had not known of a growth mindset 
        during academic endeavor until I was in secondary 
        four when we were introduced to Further Mathematics. We were shown t
        he practical ways of developing a growth mindset.
