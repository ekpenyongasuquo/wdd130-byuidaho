                <h3>Where is Lemonade Juice made?</h3>   
                <p>Level Lemonade is proudly Nigerian made and owned</p>

                <h3>Who would benefit from drinking Lemonade Juice?</h3>   
                <p>We think the ‘healthful carbonated’ drinks on the market today are simply not 
                    as appealing in taste as regular carbonated drinks. 
                    Level Lemonade has been carefully engineered for consumers after 
                    a ‘cravable’ lemonade that is actually good for you!</p>

            <section class="question">
                <h3>Why low sugar and not sugar free?</h3>   
                <p>Our drink provides half of the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) of magnesium* 
                    a total of 160mg of magnesium in one bottle. This is important because about half
                    of all Australians don't get enough magnesium in their diet. If you find you are 
                    tired throughout the day, or anxious, have sore muscles, suffer from mental fog or
                    maybe headaches and migraines the daily dose of Level Lemonade may help as these
                    are all signs of having an inadequate amount of magnesium.</p>

            <section class="question">
                <h3>Can you overdose on magnesium?</h3>   
                <p>A magnesium overdose is called hyper-magnesia. Hyper-magnesia can occur from taking too much magnesium supplement, however this is extremely rare because the kidneys work to get rid of excess magnesium.**Doses less than 410 mg of magnesium are considered safe for most adults. ** Lemonade Juice contains 160 mg..</p>
