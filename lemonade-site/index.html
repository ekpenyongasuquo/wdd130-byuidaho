                    Nigerian are returning to sparkle – "healthful carbonated" drinks are in strongest growth!

It has been carefully designed for consumers who do like a carbonated soft drink, but are looking for a “better for you” alternative. We think that Kombucha taste is NOT for everyone – but who doesn’t like a lemonade? When life hands you a Lemonade... We created a range of delicious "craveable" lemonades – that are actually good for you! LEMONADE JUICE comes in delicious flavours: Original Lemon, Lemon & Orange, Lemon & Pineapple and Lemon & Raspberry.
