      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> 

        Lemonade Juice Company, was founded in 2021 by  Asuquo Mfon, a long serving “Fast Moving Consumer Goods” enthusiast from Calabar.Under his leadership our small team were convinced that there is a chance to establish a beverage start up by focussing on drinks that are “better for you”. Since then we have successfully established ourselves through our exclusive distribution agreements with natural iced tea and energy drink brands: Calabar-Beverage and Five-Star. Since the establishment of our import/distribution business, we have been working on daring to establish our very own beverage. After years of investigation, we had decided to focus our efforts on creating a new kind of lemonade. Our team loves a lemon flavoured carbonated soft drink – but felt that current offerings lacked sophistication and were too high in sugar whilst lacking in additional health benefits. Those who had “better for you” propositions, simply did not taste good enough to sway a “die hard” carbonated soft drink endorser.

        </p>

        
        <p>

        We seized the opportunity to engage with multiple nutritional experts and product developers in our search for a “new lemonades Juice. Here the very foundations that Lemonade Juice was built upon surfaced: A tasty “crave-able” carbonated soft drink With low sugar (97.5% free) And additional benefits (High Magnesium and Vitamin C) But we did not want to distract from the fact that first and foremost it is a soft-drink: Something you would want to grab from a fridge on a hot day – not even necessarily thinking about the additional benefits but rather enjoying the thirst quenching experience. Through 5+ years of dealing with many trade partners in Nigeria, we are in the fortunate position to be granted an opportunity to present our newly created portfolio to a vast array of sales professionals. We hope it gives Lemonade Juice fighting chance it deserves to gain sufficient distribution to allow broader availability in the market place!Whilst a daring adventure lies ahead – we are quietly confident that the overwhelmingly positive responses we receive from our consumers are a representation of the great potential Lemonade Juice has!

        Our Background:
        Over the years, we have shared our favorite beverage recipes with our family and friends. 
        When we decided to open Lemonade Juice Company, we knew we wanted to produce a premium, 
        low-sugar product using high-quality ingredients. It is important for us to support our 
        local businesses by purchasing ingredients from our local farmers and other local suppliers.

        Our Process:
      	Our ingredients are sourced locally. When combined with filtered water, real lemon juice, 
        a dash of sugar and infused with local fruits like NB cranberries or NS blueberries, the result 
        is a delicious, high-quality beverage we were proud to serve to family and friends. 

        Why Lemonade Juice Company?
        We wanted a name that captured the essence of the unexpected flavors that we infuse into
        our products to create a delicious and memorable experience.

          Level Lemonade is proudly Nigerian made and owned.
        </P>
        <P>
          We think the ‘healthful carbonated’ drinks on the market today are simply not 
          as appealing in taste as regular carbonated drinks. 
          Level Lemonade has been carefully engineered for consumers after 
          a ‘cravable’ lemonade that is actually good for you!
        </P>
        <p>
          Our drink provides half of the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) of magnesium* 
          a total of 160mg of magnesium in one bottle. This is important because about half
          of all Australians don't get enough magnesium in their diet. If you find you are 
          tired throughout the day, or anxious, have sore muscles, suffer from mental fog or
          maybe headaches and migraines the daily dose of Level Lemonade may help as these
          are all signs of having an inadequate amount of magnesium.
        </p>

        
        <p>
          We believe the no sugar variants available today have an 
          inferior taste to regular carbonated drinks. With 75% less sugar 
          than regular carbonated drinks, Level Lemonade is designed for consumers 
          after a ‘cravable’ lemonade that is actually good for you – so they can have the best of both world’s!
          Our lemonade contains artificial sweeteners 955 and 950.
        </p>
        <p>
          Side effects from consuming too much Vitamin C are extremely rare and unlikely to cause 
          harm because the body cannot store the vitamin.*** Vitamin C amounts less than 2000 are considered safe.
          *** Level Lemonade contains 40mg of Vitamin C.
        </p>
        <p>
          A magnesium overdose is called hyper-magnesia. 
          Hyper-magnesia can occur from taking too much magnesium supplement, 
          however this is extremely rare because the kidneys work to get rid of excess magnesium.**
          ses less than 410 mg of magnesium are considered safe for most adults.** Level Lemonade contains 160 mg.
        </p>

        <p>
      
          Our lemonade also provides the full RDI of vitamin c. More than 25% of 
          Nigerian females and males are deficient in Vitamin C***. Stop and think,
          are you not feeling 100%? Are you stressed? Do you regularly exercise and need 
          help recovering? Are you prone to injury? All of these symptoms are signs of low Vitamin C 
          levels and if your answer is yes to any of these questions, then Level Lemonade can give 
          you the daily boost you need.
