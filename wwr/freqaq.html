                <h3>What do I do when I arrive? </h3>
                <p>If you are lodging with Whitewater on the Gorge, you will want to head to the AOTG Welcome Barn to get your keys. Remember, lodging check-in starts at 4pm. If you are heading straight to your activity, you can check the map here for the closest parking area to your building number listed on your invoice.</p>

            <section class="question">
                <h3>What time is lodging check-in? Can I check-in early? </h3>
                <p>
                Lodging check-in starts at 4 pm daily. Check out is 10:00 am on your day of departure. In season (May through October) we do not allow early check-ins or late check outs.

            <section class="question">
                <h3>May I raft if I can not swim? </h3>
                <p>
                However, understand that this is a participation sport. All rafters are required to wear a PFD (Personal Floatation Device) that will assist in keeping you afloat, however, that does not make you a swimmer. There is always a chance you could fall out of the boat and you become a participant in your own rescue.

            <section class="question">
                <h3>How many people are in each raft? </h3>
                <p>
                Our standard 16 foot boats carry 8 people plus your guide. If you would like to upgrade to a 6-man (14 ft) or 4-man (12 ft) boat, talk to your Adventure Specialist and we can add that to your reservation.

            <section class="question">
                <h3>May I take photos? </h3>
                <p>
                Our friends at White Water Photography are set up riverside to snap photos of your trip so you don’t have to worry about keeping your camera or phone dry while enjoying your rafting trip. You can purchase these photos once you’re back at Adventures on the Gorge by visiting their kiosk or head here to purchase them online.

            <section class="question">
                <h3>Do you have a place to store medications while on the river? </h3>
                <p>
                We do. Please make sure to bring any pertinent medications with you on the trip – like epinephrine, inhalers, heart medications or insulin. Communicate with your Trip Leader at trip check-in.
